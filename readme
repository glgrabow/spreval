This is a repository for development and sharing of a R package that includes various functions to evaluate both sprinkler application uniformity and efficiency.  Some of the functions, definitions, and applications, are taken from "Farm Irrigation System Evaluation:  A guide for Management by Mirriam and Keller, 1978. The functions included can be used for both agricultural and turf and landscape spinkler system evaluation.  They can also be used for evaluation of sprinkler-type irrigation equipment used in animal waste and wastewater irrigation (land application of waste).

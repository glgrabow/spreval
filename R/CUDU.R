# find  percentile of area receiving target depth or more (by area covered assuming equal area per catch can)
# x is array of catch can data, target is target application depth.  If target is soil moisture
# deficit, then similar concept as PELQ, except catch rather than application rate is used.
# to be analogous to PELQ or AELQ, a target equal to a percentile of  87.5 (mid of low quartile or 25%) for adequacy assuming a normal
# distribution, would be returned.  With a small standard deviation, however, the percentile could "look bad" but a good AELQ
# could result since this is based on averages of low quartile and overall average rather than percentile.
# Best use of percentile would be for application efficiency with a target equal to SMD, so that anything greater than SMD
# would in theory not be held in the root zone so would be inefficient. Otherwise, depending upon application uniformity, it may be
# a poor measure of system performance.  In short it is a measure of efficiency relative to a target (keep application less
# than or equal to target) rather than uniformity.  The larger the target amount, the greater the efficiency,
# assuming that less than target with stay in root zone, but a lower adequacy will result.
# Use consistent units (SI, or US custom)

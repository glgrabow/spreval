Description: This package provides functions to evaluate sprinkler irrigation uniformity and efficiency using
    standard and other measures. Standard measures include the Christiansen coefficient
    of uniformity (CU) as found in Christiansen, J.E.(1942, ISBN:0138779295,
    "Irrigation by Sprinkling"); and distrubtion uniformity (DU), potential
    efficiency of the low quarter (PELQ), and application efficiency of the low quarter (AELQ)
    are implementations of measures of the same notation in Keller, J. and Merriam, 
    J.L. (1978) "Farm Irrigation System Evaluation: A Guide for Management"
    <https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAG745.pdf>. "DUlh" is similar to DU but is
    the distribution uniformity of the low half instead of low quarter as in DU.
    "PELQT" is PELQ adapted for traveling systems instead of lateral move or
    solid-set sprinkler systems. The function "eff is analogous to the method used
    to compute application efficiency for furrow irrigation presented in Walker, W.
    and Skogerboe, G.V. (1987,ISBN:0138779295, "Surface Irrigation: Theory and Practice")
    that uses piecewise integration of infiltrated depth compared against soil-moisture
    deficit (SMD), when the argument "target" is set equal to SMD.  The other functions
    contained in the package provide graphical representation of sprinkler system
    uniformity, and other standard univariate parametric and non-parametric
    statistical measures as applied to sprinkler system catch depths.
    A sample data set of field test data "catchcan" (catch depths) is provided and
    is used in examples and vignettes.

# Development version for bugs fixes or added features
* v.1.1.0.900
This addresses bugs and adds some minor features. Values returned from  spreval::eff, i.e.,
"appeff"" and "appadeq" have been corrected.  Most functions that output plots, or allow optional plots
(i.e., eda.shape, plotss, sfplot, rotecdf) now allow optional graphical parameters to be passed via the ... convention.
A vignette to illustrate use of the package in landscape sprinkler irrigation application has been added, along with an 
accompanying landscape irrigation data added to the catchcan dataset as "catchcan$landscape".

# Second release in CRAN (2022-3-23) with bugs fixes and added features
* v.1.1.0
This addresses bugs and adds some minor features. 

## Bugs 
Values returned from spreval::eff, i.e., "appeff"" and "appadeq" have been 
corrected.  

## Added features
Most functions that output plots, or allow optional plots 
(i.e., eda.shape, plotss, sfplot,rotecdf) now allow optional graphical 
parameters to be passed via the ... convention. A vignette to illustrate 
use of the package in landscape sprinkler irrigation application has been added,
along with an accompanying landscape irrigation data added to the catchcan 
dataset as "catchcan$landscape".

### Welcome to spreval site.
The site houses the files used to construct the spreval package for use in R.  

### Description.
This package has functions for sprinkler uniformity and efficiency evaluation.  It is empirical in nature, using catch can observations from field trial to produce traditional measure of uniformity (e.g. DU, CU) but also uses non-traditional methods that employ empirical cumulative distribution functions with target depths to evaluate efficiency.  Functions are tailored to solid set, lateral move, or traveler/hose drag systems and use overlapping techniques when required to evaluate uniformity/efficiency.  Graphics are provided in some of the functions to enhance interpretation of results. 

There are vignettes to provide examples of how the functions may be used for the different types of sprinkler systems. The package includes a data set and references to the publications containing the dataset for cross-checking.  The functions and examples are applied to agricultural irrigation systems, but they can also be applied to landscape/turf irrigation system evaluation.
